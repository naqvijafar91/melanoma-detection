## General Information
- This project focuses on the classification of skin cancer types using convolutional neural networks (CNNs).
- The goal is to create a model capable of accurately detecting different skin cancer types.
- The project addresses issues such as overfitting, class imbalances, and data augmentation.
- The dataset used contains approximately 2357 images of skin cancer types, divided into 9 sub-directories representing different classes.

## Conclusions
- Overfitting was observed in the initial model, and it was successfully mitigated by introducing data augmentation techniques.
- Class imbalance was identified, and the Augmentor library was used to add more samples to minority classes, resulting in a more balanced dataset.
- The training process showed improvements after addressing overfitting and class imbalances.
- The use of data augmentation proved effective in enhancing the model's performance.
